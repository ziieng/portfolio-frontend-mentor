    <h1>Fylo</h1>
    <p>This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to 
    work to and built it so that it was fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach 
    and used modern CSS like Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes.</p>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that 
    enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge 
    includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different 
    screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve 
    real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping 
    me to improve and adapt my style.</p>
