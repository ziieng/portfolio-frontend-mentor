    <p>This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs 
    provided. I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and JavaScript for the areas that 
    required interactivity, such as the testimonial slider.</p>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that 
    enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge 
    includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different 
    screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve 
    real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping 
    me to improve and adapt my style.</p>
